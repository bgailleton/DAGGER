/*
This template provides the minimum example to use DAGGER to:
1) build a graph from a topo
2) process the node in the stack order (or inverse)
3) it also show how to fecth donors/receivers and relevant informations

Note that it generates a random mature fluvial topography using popscape but you
can replace that part feeding your own vector

To compile with g++/clang: g++ -O3 -std=c++17 -o stacker.exe -I../DAGGER
-I../popscape

DAGGER is header-only, and can be built without any dependencies, so you simply
need to make sure the includes can be found by your compiling toolchain. Here,
for simplicity, I use relative paths.
