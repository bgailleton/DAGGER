# DAGGER - Directed Acyclic Graph for digital topoGrahic manipulations Eventually cRoss-platform

`DAGGER` is a library to process digital topography. It is designed as a flexible backend engine for Topographic Analysis and Landscape Evolution Models, providing a range of method to calculate flow routing (Single/Multiple flow, receivers,donors,links,...), resolve local minima (fill, carve, reroute, ...) and a lot of related problems. Coded in `c++`, we provide example on how to use them natively with `python` (+TODO: `R,Julia,MATLAB,Js`).
