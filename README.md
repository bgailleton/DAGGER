# DAGGER - Directed Acyclic Graph for digital topoGrahic manipulations Eventually cRoss-platform

`DAGGER` is a library to process digital topography. It is designed as a flexible backend engine for Topographic Analysis and Landscape Evolution Models, providing a range of method to calculate flow routing (Single/Multiple flow, receivers,donors,links,...), resolve local minima (fill, carve, reroute, ...) and a lot of related problems. Coded in `c++`, we provide example on how to use them natively with `python` (+TODO: `R,Julia,MATLAB,Js`).

## Quickstart

- I want to use the [python version](https://github.com/bgailleton/DAGGER/tree/main/wrappers/python) (principal and most complete/maintained frontend),
- I want to use the [c++ version](https://github.com/bgailleton/DAGGER/tree/main/wrappers/cpp) (the backend),
- I am interested by the [MATLAB version](https://github.com/bgailleton/DAGGER/tree/main/wrappers/MATLAB) (still fiddling with the details, not working yet, see local README),
- To do: the other bindings

## Documentation

Detailed documentation will be on a readthedoc website (WIP)

## How to cite

A paper describing the scope and overview of the library will be submitted in [`JOSS`](https://joss.theoj.org/), and can be currently found in the file `paper.md`.

## Road map

The past and future development plan can be found in [this issue](https://github.com/bgailleton/DAGGER/issues/1) before being moved in the documentation.
