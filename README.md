# DAGGER - Directed Acyclic Graph for digital topoGrahic manipulations Eventually cRoss-platform

`DAGGER` is a library to process digital topography for geomorphological application, flow routing, local minima solver, ... It is designed as a backend engine for Topographic Analysis or Landscape Evolution Model. Coded in `c++`, we provide example on how to use them natively with `python` (TODO: `R,Julia,MATLAB,Js`).
