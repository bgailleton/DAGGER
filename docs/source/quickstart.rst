Quick start
===========

.. _quickstart:

``c++``
--------

As a header-only ``c++`` library, you simply need to include the right headers in your own ``c++`` code to use ``DAGGER`` and include the files in your local compilation system. The name of the header files depends on the modules used and can be found in the usage part of the compilation.

``python``
----------

The ``python`` package (direct bindings) can be found on the channel ``conda-forge``
