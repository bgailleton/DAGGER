Modules
===========

.. _modules:

In this sections, we present the code structure, design and philosophy as well as the different modules. It does not details all the API and the different functions but the concepts and methods of the generic modules. The structure is based on 4 distinct types of module sometimes inter-connected: the ``connector``, the ``graph``, the ``wrap_helper`` and the ``algorithms``. These modules are connected via **standardised interfaces**, *i.e.* sets of predefined functions names and signatures that need to be present in the modules.
