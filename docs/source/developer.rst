Developer guide
===============


|You can find here information for extending or helping to the development of ``DAGGER``. The global philosophy is straightforward: each module follow a **standard interface**, i.e. a list of attribute and methods the given module **absolutely needs**. 

|Of course, they can have as many additional functionalities as wanted - the standard interfaces are kept minimal to enforce unconditional compatibility between modules. Think of it like a car dashboard and its engine. No matter how fancy or cheap your dashboard is, there needs to be the same connectivy with the engine. THe rest of the dashboard are just optional.
