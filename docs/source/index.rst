DAGGER's documentation
===================================

**DAGGER** is a `c++` header-only topographic graph library specifically designed for geomorphological applications (e.g. topographic analysis, LEMs, surface flow, ...), with bindings available for higher-level languages: `python, ADD_BINDINGS_HERE`. The goal of this library is to provide a strong and versatile engine to be used as base for any software where numerical manipulation of topographic data is an essential part.`DAGGER` can be otpimised for different use cases, wheter the graph needs to be reprocessed with high performances (e.g. Landscape Evolution Modelling) or optimised for flexibility (e.g. topographic analysis).
