In graph theory, this is called a tolopogical sorting orperation and fortunately `DAGGER` provide the `stack` array from the graph object (sensu Braun and Willett 2013) which does exactly that. It can be obtained with the `get_SFD_stack` function of the graph.\n",

    "2) Iterating manually through a large array is not oprimal in `python` (it simply is not designed for that). Because of the topological order constrain, we cannot vectorise the operation with `numpy` like we did above and solving it in pure python would be slow. Thanksfully many solutions exists from coding in another language and bind the function to `python` (`fortran, C, C++, Julia` are designed for that kind of computing), or use `python`-based solutions (`pypy, cython or numba`). Here we use `numba`, which compiles compatible `python` functions to `assembly` using `llvm`. Long story short, it makes loop fast as long as it is written in a certain style (very `numpy` compatible) and that is what we are doing bellow:\n",
