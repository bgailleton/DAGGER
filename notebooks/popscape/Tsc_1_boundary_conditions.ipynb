    "\n",
    "There is no \"good\" or \"bad\" boundary conditions, it really depends on the test case. `\"4edges\"` is the least complicated way to use boundaries. However it can generate geometrical artifacts by maximising boundary effect. One way to go around that problem is to use pedriodic/cyclic boundaries. These types of boundaries connect one side of the landscape to another to simulate, for example, an infinite range. The range is not inifinite in length, but is not affected by side base level.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two built-in periodic options are: `\"periodic_EW\"` and `\"periodic_NS\"`, repectively connecting the left-right and top-bottom boundaries together. Let's try one out (feel free to test the other one). Note that I elongated the model dimensions in one of the directions."
